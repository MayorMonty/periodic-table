              <p>The periodic table of the chemical elements is a list of known Elements. In the table, the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number. The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in that particular atom. In the periodic table the elements are arranged into periods and groups.</p>

              <p>Certain properties of elements change as you move throughout the periodic table. These trends are integrated into this periodic table:</p>
              <br />
              <p><i>Atomic Radius</i> — Refers to the size from the center of an atom to the outer layer of electrons.</p>
              <p><i>Electronegativity</i> — The strength that an atom needs to attract electrons</p>
              <p><i>Ionization Energy</i> — The strength that an atom has that allows it to hold onto its electrons</p>
              <p><i>Electron Affinity</i> — The change in energy when an electron is added. It is measured in Kilomoles</p>
